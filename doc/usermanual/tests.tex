\subsection{FullTest}
\label{ss:fulltest}

The suite of tests that is run to qualify pixel modules is called
\fulltest. It is a sequential test suite that is run multiple times at
different temperatures. It is composed of the following tests, which
are described in more detail in the following sections.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \pretest: configure the basic \dacs to ensure that the \roc is
    in a basically funtioning state. In addition, optimize the readout
    settings to provide the best possible dynamic range of the \ph. 
  \item \alivetest: 
  \item \masktest:
  \item \bbtest:
  \item \trimbits:
  \item \trimming:
  \item \scurves:
  \item \thrMaps:
  \item \phcalibration:
  \item \hrmaps
\end{itemize}
